\title{A pedigree of ice and fire}
\format{
A data frame with 679 observations on 9 variables.
}
\usage{
data(ASOIAF)
}
\description{
A structured dataset of fictional characters derived from the Song of Ice and
 Fire universe by George R. R. Martin. The character relationships were
 partially based on a GEDCOM file publicly posted in the
 [Westeros.org forum](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/88863-all-the-family-trees/),
 and were updated based on publicly available summaries from
[A Wiki of Ice and Fire](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Main_Page).
This dataset was created for educational and illustrative purposes, such as
demonstrating pedigree construction, relationship tracing, and algorithmic
logic in family-based data. It includes no narrative content or protected
expression from the original works. No rights to the characters, names, or
intellectual property of George R. R. Martin or HBO are claimed, and the
dataset is not intended to represent any real individuals or families.
