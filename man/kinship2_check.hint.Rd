\title{Check kinship2 hints for consistency}
\usage{
kinship2_check.hint(hints, sex)
}
\arguments{
\item{hints}{A list containing kinship2 hints, including `order` and optionally `spouse`.}

\item{sex}{A character vector indicating the sex of each individual
('male' or 'female').}
}
\value{
The original `hints` list if all checks pass; otherwise, an error is raised.
}
\description{
This function checks the consistency of kinship2 hints, particularly
focusing on the `order` and `spouse` components. It ensures that the
order is numeric and matches the length of the `sex` vector, and that
marriages are valid male/female pairs without duplicates.
}
\details{
Extracted from checks.Rnw
This routine tries to remove inconsistencies in spousal hints.
These and arise in autohint with complex pedigrees.
One can have ABA (subject A is on both the
left and the right of B), cycles, etc.
Actually, these used to arise in autohint, I don't know if it's so after the recent rewrite.
Users can introduce problems as well if they modify the hints.
