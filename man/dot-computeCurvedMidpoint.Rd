\title{Compute point along a curved segment (quadratic Bézier)}
\usage{
.computeCurvedMidpoint(x0, y0, x1, y1, curvature, angle, shift = 0, t = 0.5)

computeCurvedMidpoint(x0, y0, x1, y1, curvature, angle, shift = 0, t = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x0}{Numeric vector. X-coordinates of start points.}

\item{y0}{Numeric vector. Y-coordinates of start points.}

\item{x1}{Numeric vector. X-coordinates of end points.}

\item{y1}{Numeric vector. Y-coordinates of end points.}

\item{curvature}{Curvature scale factor (as in
*geom_curve*-style helpers): the control point is placed at a distance
`curvature * len` from the segment midpoint in the rotated-perpendicular
direction. Changing the sign flips the bend to the opposite side (after
rotation).}

\item{angle}{Scalar numeric. Base rotation in degrees applied to the perpendicular before offsetting.}

\item{shift}{Scalar numeric. Additional rotation in degrees (default 0). Effective rotation is angle + shift.}

\item{t}{Numeric scalar or vector in [0, 1]. Bézier parameter where 0 is the start point,
1 is the end point; default 0.5.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns x, y, and t representing the coordinates along the curved segment.
}
\description{
Computes the x–y coordinates of a point along a curved segment connecting
(x0, y0) to (x1, y1) using a quadratic Bézier construction. The control
point is defined by an orthogonal offset from the straight-line midpoint,
scaled by curvature * len and rotated by angle + shift (degrees).
Vectorized over input coordinates and t.
}
\details{
* The unit perpendicular is constructed from the segment direction
  `(dx, dy)` as `(-uy, ux)` where `(ux, uy) = (dx, dy) / len`.
* If an input pair yields `len = 0` (identical endpoints), the unit
  direction is undefined and the resulting coordinates will be `NA`
  due to division by zero; inputs should avoid zero-length segments.
* Inputs of unequal length are recycled by base R. Prefer supplying
  conformable vectors to avoid unintended recycling.
