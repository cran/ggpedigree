\title{Compute distance between two points}
\usage{
computeDistance(method = "euclidean", x1, y1, x2, y2, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Character. Method of distance calculation. Options are "euclidean", "cityblock", and "Minkowski".}

\item{x1}{Numeric. X-coordinate of the first point.}

\item{y1}{Numeric. Y-coordinate of the first point.}

\item{x2}{Numeric. X-coordinate of the second point.}

\item{y2}{Numeric. Y-coordinate of the second point.}

\item{p}{Numeric. The order of the Minkowski distance. If NULL, defaults to 2 for Euclidean and 1 for Manhattan. If
Minkowski method is used, p should be specified.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the distance between two points in a 2D space using
Minkowski distance. It can be used to compute Euclidean or Manhattan distance.
It is a utility function for calculating distances in pedigree layouts.
Defaults to Euclidean distance if no method is specified.
