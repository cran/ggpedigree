\title{Calculate the depth (generation level) of subjects in a pedigree}
\usage{
kinship2_kindepth(id, dad.id, mom.id, align = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Either a pedigree/pedigreeList object, or a vector of subject IDs}

\item{dad.id}{Vector of father IDs (required if `id` is not a pedigree object)}

\item{mom.id}{Vector of mother IDs (required if `id` is not a pedigree object)}

\item{align}{Logical, if TRUE attempts to align married couples at the same
depth level for better visualization (default FALSE)}
}
\value{
Integer vector of depth values for each subject, where 0 = founder,
  1 = child of founder, etc.
}
\description{
This function computes the depth of each subject in a pedigree, defined as
the maximal number of generations of ancestors (distance to the farthest founder).
Optionally aligns spouses to plot on the same generation level.
}
\details{
When `align=TRUE`, the function adjusts depths so that married couples appear
on the same generation level when possible. This produces more aesthetically
pleasing pedigree plots. The alignment algorithm handles marry-ins, multiple
marriages, and inbreeding loops.
