  status,

\arguments{
\item{id}{Identification variable for individual}

\item{dadid}{Identification variable for father. Founders' parents should be coded
to NA, or another value specified by missid.}

\item{momid}{Identification variable for mother. Founders' parents should be coded
to NA, or another value specified by missid.}

\item{sex}{Gender of individual noted in `id'. Either character ("male","female",
"unknown","terminated") or numeric (1="male", 2="female", 3="unknown", 4="terminated")
data is allowed.  For character data the string may be truncated, and of arbitrary case.}

\item{affected}{A variable indicating affection status.  A multi-column matrix
can be used to give the status with respect to multiple traits. Logical, factor, and
integer types are converted to 0/1 representing unaffected and affected, respectively.
NAs are considered missing.}

\item{status}{Censor/Vital status (0="censored", 1="dead")}

\item{relation}{A matrix with 3 required columns (id1, id2, code) specifying special
relationship between pairs of individuals. Codes: 1=Monozygotic twin,  2=Dizygotic twin,
3=Twin of unknown zygosity, 4=Spouse. (The last is necessary in order to place a marriage
with no children into the plot.) If famid is given in the call to create pedigrees, then
famid needs to be in the last column of the relation matrix. Note for tuples of >= 3 with
a mixture of zygosities, the plotting is limited to showing pairwise zygosity of adjacent
subjects, so it is only necessary to specify the pairwise zygosity, in the order the subjects
are given or appear on the plot.}

\item{famid}{An optional vector of family identifiers.  If it is present the result will
contain individual pedigrees for each family in the set, which can be extacted using
subscripts. Individuals need to have a unique id \emph{within} family.}

\item{missid}{The founders are those with no father or mother in the pedigree. The dadid
and momid values for these subjects will either be NA or the value of this variable. The
default for missid is 0 if the id variable is numeric, and "" (empty string) otherwise.}

\item{max_message_n}{max number of individuals to list in error messages}

\item{x}{pedigree object in print and subset methods}

\item{...}{optional arguments passed to internal functions}

\item{drop}{logical, used in subset function for dropping dimensionality}
