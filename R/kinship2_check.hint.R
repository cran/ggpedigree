#' @title Check kinship2 hints for consistency
#'
#' @description
#' This function checks the consistency of kinship2 hints, particularly
#' focusing on the `order` and `spouse` components. It ensures that the
#' order is numeric and matches the length of the `sex` vector, and that
#' marriages are valid male/female pairs without duplicates.
#' @param hints A list containing kinship2 hints, including `order` and optionally `spouse`.
#' @param sex A character vector indicating the sex of each individual
#' ('male' or 'female').
#' @return The original `hints` list if all checks pass; otherwise, an error is raised.
#' @keywords internal
#' @details Extracted from checks.Rnw
#' This routine tries to remove inconsistencies in spousal hints.
#' These and arise in autohint with complex pedigrees.
#' One can have ABA (subject A is on both the
#' left and the right of B), cycles, etc.
#' Actually, these used to arise in autohint, I don't know if it's so after the recent rewrite.
#' Users can introduce problems as well if they modify the hints.
