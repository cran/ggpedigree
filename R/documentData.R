#' A pedigree of ice and fire
#'
#' A structured dataset of fictional characters derived from the Song of Ice and Fire universe by George R. R. Martin.
#' The character relationships were partially based on a GEDCOM file publicly posted in the [Westeros.org forum](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/88863-all-the-family-trees/), and were updated based on publicly available summaries from [A Wiki of Ice and Fire](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Main_Page).
#' This dataset was created for educational and illustrative purposes, such as demonstrating pedigree construction, relationship tracing, and algorithmic logic in family-based data.
#' It includes no narrative content or protected expression from the original works.
#' No rights to the characters, names, or intellectual property of George R. R. Martin or HBO are claimed, and the dataset is not intended to represent any real individuals or families.

#' The variables are as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{id}:  Person identification variable
#'   \item \code{momID}:  ID of the mother
#'   \item \code{dadID}:  ID of the father
#'   \item \code{name}:  Name of the person
#'   \item \code{sex}: Biological sex
#'   \item \code{twinID}:  ID of the twin, if applicable
