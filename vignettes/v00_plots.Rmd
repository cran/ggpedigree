# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates pedigree visualization with `ggPedigree()` from `ggpedigree`. Pedigree plots are central to fields like human genetics, behavioral science, and genealogy, where understanding lineage and familial relationships informs diagnosis, analysis, and interpretation. 

`ggPedigree()` builds on `ggplot2` and `kinship2`, leveraging modular helpers from both `{BGmisc}` and `{ggpedigree}` to streamline plot generation while retaining full aesthetic flexibility.

Unlike base R pedigree tools, this package returns a `ggplot2` object, meaning users can customize their output using familiar `ggplot2` syntax, themes, scales, and layering. Throughout this vignette, we walk through basic usage, layout control, status overlays, aesthetic customization, and faceting for multifamily visualization.

We use two bundled example datasets (from `BGmisc`) to illustrate the package's capabilities. The first dataset, `potter`, contains a fictional wizarding family tree, while the second dataset, `hazard`, includes a multigenerational historical pedigree with affected/unaffected status. 


# Basic usage

We begin by loading the required libraries. These include the main plotting package `ggpedigree`, helper utilities from `BGmisc`, and supporting tools for aesthetic and data manipulation.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggpedigree) # ggPedigree lives here
library(BGmisc) # helper utilities & example data
library(ggplot2) # ggplot2 for plotting
library(viridis) # viridis for color palettes
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling
```


The simplest usage requires a data frame and column names for family and individual IDs. Hereâ€™s a basic pedigree plot using the `potter` data:

```{r load-data, include=FALSE}
# if you don't have the most recent version of BGmisc, you may need to install it first as a stop-gap I've added the data loading here
data("potter") # load example data from BGmisc
# if (!"twinID" %in% names(potter)) {
# Add twinID and zygosity columns for demonstration purposes
potter <- potter %>%
  mutate(
    twinID = case_when(
      name == "Fred Weasley" ~ 13,
      name == "George Weasley" ~ 12,
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    ),
    zygosity = case_when(
      name == "Fred Weasley" ~ "mz",
      name == "George Weasley" ~ "mz",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  )
# }
```


```{r basic-usage}
ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID"
)
```

Behind the scenes, `ggPedigree()`:

1. reshapes the data by family (`ped2fam()`),

2. recodes sex (e.g., 0/1/NA) into semantic labels via `recodeSex()`

3. extracts a layout grid with `calculateCoordinates()`

4. builds connection segments for spouses, siblings, parents, and offspring with `calculateConnections()`

The result is returned as a `ggplot2` object, which allows immediate post-processing with standard `ggplot` syntax.

# Customizing Aesthetics

Most appearance settings are managed through a `config` list, which allows for fine-tuned customization. If any options are omitted, they fall back to predefined defaults. For example, we can turn off sex-based fill color and assign specific colors to connection segments, while also changing the shapes of individuals in the pedigree:

```{r customize-aesthetics}
ggPedigree(
  potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  config = list(
    code_male = 1, # Here, 1 = male, 0 = female
    sex_color_include = FALSE,
    point_size = 5,
    outline_multiplier = 1.15,
    line_width = 2.5,
    sex_shape_female = "ðŸ’¸",
    sex_shape_male = "ðŸ–¤",
    segment_spouse_color = viridis_pal()(5)[1],
    segment_sibling_color = viridis_pal()(5)[2],
    segment_parent_color = viridis_pal()(5)[3],
    segment_offspring_color = viridis_pal()(5)[4],
    segment_mz_color = viridis_pal()(5)[5],
    #   segment_linetype = 3,
    outline_include = TRUE,
    outline_color = "grey" # viridis_pal()(5)[5]
  )
)
```

As with any `ggplot2` object, further theming and labeling can be applied using layers or themes. For instance:


```{r}
ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID"
) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 12)
```

This can be particularly useful for matching house styles in academic publications or removing clutter for presentations.

## Labeling Individuals

You can also label individuals in the pedigree using the `label_method` argument. The default is `geom_label_repel()`, which uses the `ggrepel` package to avoid overlapping labels. You can also use `geom_text()` for simpler labeling. Other configurable options include `label_col` for the label column, `label_text_angle` for text rotation, `label_nudge_y` for vertical adjustment, and `label_nudge_x` for horizontal adjustment.

```{r}
ggPedigree(
  potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  config = list(
    label_col = "name",
    sex_color_palette = c("pink", "blue"),
    label_text_angle = -45,
    label_nudge_y = -.25,
    label_nudge_x = 0.45,
    label_method = "geom_text",
    #   sex_color_palette = c("black", "black"),
    sex_color_include = TRUE
  )
)
```

# Overlaying Status Information

In many applied settings, pedigrees include binary phenotypes such as affected/unaffected status. To incorporate this, use the `status_column` argument to point to a column containing the relevant variable.

```{r}
data("hazard")

p <- ggPedigree(
  hazard,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "ID",
  status_column = "affected",
  config = list(
    code_male = 0,
    sex_color_include = TRUE,
    status_code_affected = TRUE,
    status_code_unaffected = FALSE,
    status_shape_affected = 4
  )
)

p
```

The `status_column` argument allows you to specify a column that identifies affected/unaffected individuals. This column should be a factor or character vector; if not, `ggPedigree()` will coerce it.

The behavior differs depending on whether `sex_color_include` is also enabled:

* If `sex_color_include = TRUE`, affected individuals are overlaid with a shape (controlled by `status_shape_affected`), preserving the fill color by sex.

* If `sex_color_include = FALSE`, affected and unaffected individuals are instead colored by status, using a default fill scale.

You can control how values are interpreted via the `affected` and `unaffected` parameters in `config`. By default, `TRUE` is considered affected and `FALSE` unaffected.


```{r}
ggPedigree(
  hazard,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "ID",
  status_column = "affected",
  config = list(
    code_male = 0,
    sex_color_include = FALSE,
    status_code_affected = TRUE,
    status_code_unaffected = FALSE,
    status_label_affected = "Infected",
    status_label_unaffected = "Not infected",
    status_legend_title = "Status"
  )
)
```

## Highlighting Specific Individuals

You can also highlight specific individuals in the pedigree through other approaches, such as by creating a new column in your data frame. For example, if you want to highlight Harry Potter and Dudley Dursley, you can create a new column called `proband` and set it to `TRUE` for those individuals. You can specify the `status_shape_affected` to be a star shape (8) and use the `status_column` argument to indicate the probands.

```{r}
df <- potter

df <- df %>%
  mutate(proband = ifelse(name %in% c(
    "Harry Potter",
    "Dudley Dursley"
  ), TRUE, FALSE))

ggPedigree(
  df,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  status_column = "proband",
  config = list(
    sex_color_include = TRUE,
    status_include = TRUE,
    status_code_affected = TRUE,
    status_code_unaffected = FALSE,
    status_shape_affected = 8 # "âœ¨"  # star shape
  )
)
```

## Highlighting Harry Potter

Alternatively, you can use what I've called focal filling. The `focal_fill` argument allows you to highlight one person and their relatives without modifying the data frame. This is particularly useful when you want to emphasize a specific individual, such as Harry Potter, in the pedigree plot. The `focal_fill_personID` argument allows you to specify the person ID to highlight, and the `focal_fill_include` argument determines whether to include this highlighting in the plot. Other arguments like `focal_fill_method`, `focal_fill_n_breaks`, and `focal_fill_scale_midpoint` control the appearance of the highlighted area. Notably, you can select focal_fill_component to a specific component, such as "additive", which will highlight the additive genetic relatives of the focal person. 


```{r focal_fill}
ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  config = list(
    focal_fill_personID = 7,
    focal_fill_include = TRUE,
    #  focal_fill_high_color = "yellow",
    #  focal_fill_mid_color = "red",
    #   focal_fill_low_color = "#0D082AFF",
    focal_fill_force_zero = TRUE,
    focal_fill_na_value = "black",
    focal_fill_scale_midpoint = 0.25,
    focal_fill_component = "additive",
    focal_fill_method = "gradient",
    focal_fill_n_breaks = NULL,
    focal_fill_legend_title = "Genetic Relatives \nof Harry Potter",
    # "additive",
    sex_color_include = FALSE
  ) # highlight Harry Potter
  # config  = list(segment_mz_color = NA) # color for monozygotic twins
)
```

Here we highlight Harry Potter (ID 7) and his relatives in the pedigree plot. Other components can be highlighted by changing the `focal_fill_component` argument. For example, you can set it to "mitochondrial" to highlight mitochondrial relatives, or "x" to highlight X-linked relatives. The `focal_fill_method` can be set to "gradient" for a smooth gradient effect or "steps" for distinct color breaks.


```{r focal_fill_mitochondrial}
m1 <- ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  config = list(
    focal_fill_personID = 7,
    focal_fill_include = TRUE,
    focal_fill_high_color = "green",
    # focal_fill_mid_color = "white",
    focal_fill_low_color = "black",
    focal_fill_scale_midpoint = 0.55,
    focal_fill_component = "mitochondrial",
    focal_fill_method = "steps",
    focal_fill_n_breaks = 19,
    focal_fill_legend_show = FALSE,
    focal_fill_legend_title = "Mitochondrial Relatives \nof Harry Potter",
    sex_color_include = FALSE
  ) # highlight Harry Potter
  # config  = list(segment_mz_color = NA) # color for monozygotic twins
) + ggplot2::guides(shape = "none")
m2 <- ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  config = list(
    focal_fill_personID = 8,
    focal_fill_include = TRUE,
    focal_fill_high_color = "orange",
    # focal_fill_mid_color = "white",
    focal_fill_low_color = "black",
    focal_fill_scale_midpoint = 0.55,
    focal_fill_component = "mitochondrial",
    focal_fill_method = "steps",
    focal_fill_n_breaks = 19,
    focal_fill_legend_show = FALSE,
    focal_fill_legend_title = "Mitochondrial Relatives \nof Ginny Weasley",
    sex_color_include = FALSE
  ) # highlight Harry Potter
  # config  = list(segment_mz_color = NA) # color for monozygotic twins
) + ggplot2::guides(shape = "none")

library(patchwork) # for combining plots
m1 + m2 + plot_layout(ncol = 2) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Mitochondrial Relatives of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley")
```


```{r focal_fill_matID}
ggPedigree(potter,
  famID = "famID",
  personID = "personID",
  config = list(
    focal_fill_personID = 8,
    focal_fill_include = TRUE,
    # focal_fill_mid_color = "white",
    focal_fill_low_color = "black",
    focal_fill_scale_midpoint = 0.55,
    focal_fill_component = "matID",
    focal_fill_method = "viridis_d",
    focal_fill_viridis_option = "turbo",
    focal_fill_n_breaks = 19,
    focal_fill_legend_show = FALSE,
    focal_fill_legend_title = "Mitochondrial Relatives",
    sex_color_include = FALSE,
    overlay_include = FALSE
  ) # highlight Harry Potter
  # config  = list(segment_mz_color = NA) # color for monozygotic twins
) + ggplot2::guides(shape = "none")

```

# Multiple families in one graphic

If you have multiple families in your data frame, you can use the `facet_wrap()` function from `ggplot2` to create separate plots for each family. This is useful if you want to compare the pedigrees of different families side by side. Note that you can use `scales = "free_x"` to allow each family to have its own x-axis scale.

```{r facet_wrap}
p +
  facet_wrap(~famID, scales = "free_x")
```

# Adjusting Plot Appearance

The layout appearance can be refined using `theme()` elements. This doesn't change the pedigree structure but helps declutter the visualization.

```{r}
p +
  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    axis.line        = element_line(colour = "black"),
    axis.text.x      = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y      = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x     = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y     = element_blank(),
    axis.title.x     = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y     = element_blank()
  ) + scale_color_viridis(
    option = "mako",
    discrete = TRUE,
    labels = c("Female", "Male", "Unknown")
  )
```

# Advanced Examples: Large Pedigrees with self-loops

Additional examples are provided as articles that demonstrate more complex pedigree plots. You can find these on the [ggpedigree website](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/ggpedigree/). These articles cover advanced topics such as: multiple families, self-loops, and other advanced features.
