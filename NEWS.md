# ggpedigree 0.8.0
## joss paper submitted
* Makes ggrepel a suggested package instead of a required one.
* Make connections included in the plot by default.
* Expose linejoin in ggRelatednessMatrix
* Expose outline_additive and outline_alpha to ggpedigree

# ggpedigree 0.7.0
* Changed the default behavior of `ggPedigree` to use x_fam and y_fam for positioning families, rather than x_mid_parent and y_mid_parent. This change improves visualization of pedigrees with many families.
