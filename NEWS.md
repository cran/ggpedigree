# ggpedigree (dev version)

# ggpedigree 0.8.0
* Makes ggrepel a suggested package instead of a required one.
* Make connections included in the plot by default.
* Expose linejoin in ggRelatednessMatrix
* Expose outline_additive and outline_alpha to ggpedigree
* Refactored the ggpedigree function to improve readability and maintainability.
* Transferring ASOIAF data from BGmisc to ggpedigree

# ggpedigree 0.7.1
* Fixed focal_fill ID being indexed to row order, rather than the ID order.
* Fixed bug in using fam_x and fam_y in with generation_height
* Add option to add phantom parents to the pedigree plot.
* Alerts when duplicate or bad configs are used
* Make palleter suggested instead of required

# ggpedigree 0.7.0
* Changed the default behavior of `ggPedigree` to use x_fam and y_fam for positioning families, rather than x_midparent and y_midparent. This change allows for better visualization of pedigrees with multiple families.
* Changed the get midpoint of curvature to better approximate geom_curv behavior.
* reduced redundancy in code base by not calculating the parent midpoints when not needed.
* Added default_config support for ggRelatednessMatrix functions.

# ggpedigree 0.6.1
* Transferred `plotPedigree()` function from BGmisc to ggpedigree.

# ggpedigree 0.6.0
* Implemented fill by matID, patID using several scales, such as hue, viridis, and others.
* Added support for emojis in the `ggpedigree` function.
* Solved the bug that created excessive branches
* Made the twin sibling segments smarter
* Adding more debug support

# ggpedigree 0.5.1
* Fix tooltip appearing in `ggPedigreeInteractive` when tooltip_include is set to FALSE.

# ggpedigree 0.5.0
* Added segment_linetype and custom affected labels to the `ggpedigree` function.
* Added usage of color_palette to the `ggpedigree` function.
* Added curvature option to the `ggpedigree` function.
* Add support for custom affected labels for affected individuals in the `ggpedigree` function.
* Add support for removing diagonal, upper triangle, and lower triangle in the `ggRelatednessMatrix` function.
* Add support for labeling tiles
* Added new tests for the `ggRelatednessMatrix` function.
* Added new phenotype plotting function `ggPhenotypebyDegree` to visualize phenotypes by degree of relatedness.
* Added new vignette to demonstrate `ggPhenotypebyDegree`.
* Added a new function `getDefaultPlotConfig` to set default configuration options for the package.
* Harmonized the configuration options across the package to use `getDefaultPlotConfig` and buildPlotConfig
* Added unit tests for `getDefaultPlotConfig` and `ggPhenotypebyDegree`
* Added workaround for plotly non-support for geom_curve with computeCurvedMidpoint
* Adding fully twin plotting features
* Added ability to fill colors as a function of the degree of relatedness to a focal person
* Add getDefaultPlotConfig functionality to ggPhenotypebyDegree
* Fully documented getDefaultPlotConfig so that each config option is clear and understandable.

# ggpedigree 0.4.1
## Status: Submitted to CRAN
* Fixed a bug in the `ggpedigree` function that caused an error when using a custom ID name and requesting the plot to be returned as a ggplot object.

# ggpedigree 0.4.0
* Allows support for character-based IDs
* Added linejoin, lineend, segment_self_linetype, option to the `ggpedigree` functions.
* Added unit tests for calculateConnections, calculateConnections, and ggpedigree functions.
* Refactored ggpedigree function into ggpedigree.core and .addScales and .addLabels functions to improve readability and maintainability.
* Renamed symKey to makeSymmetricKey, extended it to support character-based IDs, and added unit tests.
